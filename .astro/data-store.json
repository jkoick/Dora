If you have requested this information to be provided by electronic means, it will be provided to you electronically, if technically possible.\n\n#### Right to rectification\n\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the information we hold about you. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please do not hesitate to ask us to correct, update or supplement this information.\n\n#### Right to erasure\n\nYou have the right to ask us to erase your personal data, for example where the personal data we have collected about you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally processed. However, your right must be assessed in the light of all the relevant circumstances. For example, we may have certain legal and regulatory obligations which mean we will not be able to comply with your request.\n\n#### Right to restriction of processing\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to stop using your personal information. For example, if you believe that the personal information we hold about you may be inaccurate or if you believe that we no longer need to use your personal information.\n\n#### Consent\n\nWe may process your personal data based on consent. We will be specifically informed about such processing in advance. In cases where we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent electronically, at the address of the Responsible Person, in writing, by notification of withdrawal of consent or in person at the office. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing of personal data that we processed about you based on it.\n\n#### Right to data portability\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to transfer the personal data you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. However, the right to portability only applies to personal data that we have obtained from you based on consent or on the basis of a contract to which you are a party.\n\n#### Right to object\n\nYou have the right to object to data processing that is based on our legitimate interests.
