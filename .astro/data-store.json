It ensures that firms can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.\n\nIntroduced by the European Commission, DORA enforces consistent risk management frameworks and testing practices across the industry—ensuring financial stability and consumer protection.\n\n---\n\n### Testování Bezpečnostních Opatření IKT\n\n**Testování bezpečnostních opatření IKT** is a cornerstone of DORA compliance. It involves:\n\n- **Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT):** Simulated attacks to identify system vulnerabilities\n- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Routine scans to evaluate and patch weaknesses\n- **Incident Response Evaluation:** Drills and audits to test readiness and crisis procedures\n- **Third-Party Risk Testing:** Ensuring external partners uphold security standards\n- **Network and Application Layer Testing:** In-depth review of infrastructure under real-world conditions\n\n---\n\n### Why DORA Testing Matters\n\nAs digital services expand, the potential attack surface grows. Without robust testing protocols, organizations are vulnerable to:\n\n- Data breaches and service downtime\n- Financial and reputational damage\n- Non-compliance penalties from EU regulatory bodies\n\n**DORA testing ensures:**\n\n- Operational continuity\n- Evidence-based security improvements\n- Resilience against cyber threats\n- Auditability and accountability\n\n---\n\n### Who Needs to Comply?\n\nDORA applies to a wide range of entities, including but not limited to:\n\n- Banks and insurance companies\n- Investment firms and payment processors\n- Cloud service providers and software vendors\n- Managed security services and analytics platforms\n\nIf your organization supports any critical digital function in the EU's financial ecosystem, DORA compliance is not optional—it's a mandate.\n\n---\n\n### Preparing for DORA Testing\n\nTo prepare for DORA compliance, organizations should:\n\n1. **Conduct a Gap Analysis** to assess current security posture\n2. **Develop an ICT Risk Management Framework** based on DORA guidelines\n3. **Design a Threat-Led Testing Strategy** aligned with sector-specific threats\n4. **Integrate Reporting Systems** to document and escalate incidents\n5. **Engage with Third-Party Experts** for independent evaluations\n\n---\n\n### Ready to Get Compliant?\n\nAchieving DORA compliance isn't just a legal requirement—it’s a strategic investment in your digital resilience. We help organizations implement structured, real-world testing of ICT defenses to ensure readiness and trustworthiness.\n\n📩 **[Contact us today](/contact/)** to begin your path to DORA-aligned operational security.","src/content/integration/ICTSecurityMeasures.md","140b805084e0240b",{"html":864,"metadata":865},"\u003Ch4 id=\"what-is-dora\">What Is DORA?\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)\u003C/strong> is an EU regulation that aims to strengthen the IT security of financial institutions and critical ICT service providers.

Common activities include:\n\n- **Functional Testing:** Verifying that systems behave correctly under expected conditions\n- **Integration Testing:** Ensuring new components integrate cleanly with existing infrastructure\n- **Performance Testing:** Measuring system load capacity, latency, and responsiveness\n- **Security Testing:** Checking for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations introduced by the changes\n- **Rollback Validation:** Confirming that rollback procedures are documented and executable\n\n---\n\n### Maintenance-Related Testing Activities\n\nDuring maintenance, it's essential to test changes both **before and after** implementation:\n\n- **Pre-Maintenance Staging Tests:** Replicating the update in a test environment\n- **Change Impact Analysis:** Evaluating dependencies, affected services, and risk areas\n- **Backup Verification:** Ensuring critical data snapshots are valid before changes\n- **Post-Maintenance Sanity Checks:** Validating system behavior after applying updates\n- **Monitoring & Alerting Validation:** Confirming visibility of key metrics during and after change windows\n\n---\n\n### Best Practices for ICT System Testing\n\n1. **Use Representative Test Environments:** Mirror production settings as closely as possible\n2. **Automate Regression Tests:** Re-run test suites to catch unintended side effects\n3. **Involve Stakeholders:** Developers, infrastructure, security, and business teams should all review change plans\n4. **Document Test Results:** Maintain an audit trail of all test cases, outcomes, and lessons learned\n5. **Use a Change Approval Process:** No deployment should occur without formal testing sign-off\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of Pre-Deployment and Maintenance Testing\n\n- Avoid costly outages and service disruptions\n- Detect and fix bugs or security flaws early\n- Improve user satisfaction and operational reliability\n- Reduce emergency rollbacks and unplanned downtime\n- Align with ITIL, ISO 27001, and other compliance standards\n\n---\n\n### Use Cases Where Testing Is Essential\n\n- Software version upgrades (OS, database, application)\n- Infrastructure changes (servers, network equipment, cloud services)\n- Security patching\n- Deployment of new features or services\n- Configuration changes to authentication, logging, or access controls\n\n---\n\n### Be Proactive, Not Reactive\n\nTesting before deployment or maintenance is an investment in resilience.
