Personal data are stored for the period necessary to fulfill the purpose of processing, or for the period stipulated by legal regulations. Personal data will typically be deleted within 24 months of fulfilling the purpose of processing. Personal data used in connection with bookkeeping are stored for 10 years.\n\n2. After this period expires, personal data will be securely deleted or anonymized, unless further storage is necessary to protect the Controller's rights or to fulfill legal obligations.\n\n### Rights of data subjects\n\nData subjects have the following rights in relation to the processing of personal data:\n\n### Right of access\n\nYou have the right to be provided with a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as information about how we use your personal data. In most cases, your personal data will be provided to you in written electronic form, unless you request it to be provided in another way. If you have requested this information to be provided by electronic means, it will be provided to you electronically, if technically possible.\n\n### Right to rectification\n\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the information we hold about you. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please do not hesitate to ask us to correct, update or supplement this information.\n\n### Right to erasure\n\nYou have the right to ask us to erase your personal data, for example where the personal data we have collected about you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally processed. However, your right must be assessed in the light of all the relevant circumstances. For example, we may have certain legal and regulatory obligations which mean we will not be able to comply with your request.\n\n### Right to restriction of processing\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to stop using your personal information. For example, if you believe that the personal information we hold about you may be inaccurate or if you believe that we no longer need to use your personal information.\n\n### Consent\n\nWe may process your personal data based on consent. We will be specifically informed about such processing in advance. In cases where we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent electronically, at the address of the Responsible Person, in writing, by notification of withdrawal of consent or in person at the office. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing of personal data that we processed about you based on it.\n\n### Right to data portability\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to transfer the personal data you have provided to us to another third party of your choice. However, the right to portability only applies to personal data that we have obtained from you based on consent or on the basis of a contract to which you are a party.\n\n### Right to object\n\nYou have the right to object to data processing that is based on our legitimate interests. If we do not have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing and you object, we will no longer process your personal data.\n\n### Right to file a complaint\n\nIf you believe that we are processing your personal data unfairly or unlawfully, you may file a complaint with the supervisory authority, which is the Office for Personal Data Protection of the Czech Republic, https://uoou.gov.cz/en, Office for Personal Data Protection Pplk. Sochora 27 170 00 Prague 7 tel. number: +420 234 665 111; E-mail: posta@uoou.gov.cz\n\nData subjects may exercise their rights in writing or electronically via the Operator's contact details provided in this document.\n\n### Data safety\n\n#### Security of Personal Data\n\n**HOW**  \nEven though we implement security measures designed to protect your data, no security system is impenetrable. Due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that data will be absolutely safe from interference by others during transmission over the internet or while stored in our systems.\n\nExamples of security measures we use:\n\n- SSL technologies to ensure full encryption\n- PCI scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other breaches\n- Encrypted and password-protected databases\n- Antivirus software\n\n**WHERE**  \nYour data is stored on our servers in the Czech Republic; your personal data never leaves the EEA.

Your personal data will be completely deleted from backup storage as soon as this is possible under the backup rules. Personal data stored in backup repositories serve to prevent security incidents, particularly disruptions to data availability resulting from a security incident. The controller is obliged to ensure data backups in accordance with the security requirements of the Regulation and the Personal Data Protection Act. We store your personal data only for a limited time, and it will be deleted when it is no longer needed for the processing purposes as set out in the appendix to this statement.\n\n### Changes\n\nFrom time to time, we may change this document.
