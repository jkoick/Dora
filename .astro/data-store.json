This program must cover all **critical ICT systems, processes, and services**, including those provided by third parties. The aim is to **identify vulnerabilities**, test the **effectiveness of controls**, and ensure **rapid recovery** from incidents.\n\n---\n\n## Our Testing Services\n\n### Security and Functionality\n\n**Testing of ICT Systems**  \nWe conduct structured assessments of your ICT infrastructure to verify that security controls and business-critical functionalities operate as intended. This includes reviewing **access management**, **data protection**, **system configurations**, and **compliance with security policies**. The goal is to proactively identify weaknesses that could impact **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.\n\n---\n\n### Vulnerability Assessment\n\nOur vulnerability assessments use **automated and manual techniques** to identify known and emerging vulnerabilities across your systems, applications, and networks. We **prioritize findings based on risk** and provide **actionable recommendations** for remediation, helping you stay ahead of evolving threats.\n\n---\n\n### Penetration Testing\n\nWe simulate **real-world cyberattacks** targeting your most critical assets, using both **internal and external perspectives**. Our approach follows **industry best practices and regulatory expectations**, uncovering exploitable weaknesses and testing the **effectiveness of your detection and response capabilities**.\n\n---\n\n### Business Continuity and Recovery Testing\n\nWe design and execute scenarios that challenge your **business continuity and disaster recovery plans**. This includes simulating **system outages, data loss, or supplier failures** to validate your ability to restore operations within defined **recovery time and point objectives**. The exercises ensure that **backup, failover, and communication processes** are effective and well-coordinated.\n\n---\n\n### Incident Response Testing\n\nOur incident response tests evaluate your team’s readiness to **detect, manage, and recover from ICT incidents**. Through **tabletop exercises and live simulations**, we assess the **clarity of escalation paths**, **communication protocols**, and the **speed and accuracy** of incident containment and service restoration.\n\n---\n\n## Value Delivered\n\n- Full alignment with DORA’s regulatory requirements, supporting audit readiness and supervisory expectations\n- Identification and remediation of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited\n- Increased confidence in the resilience of critical ICT systems and processes\n- Enhanced preparedness for disruptive events through realistic, organization-specific testing scenarios\n- Continuous improvement of digital operational resilience based on lessons learned and industry best practices\n\n---\n\n**Our services are tailored to your organization’s size, risk profile, and operational complexity**, ensuring that your digital operational resilience testing program is both effective and compliant with the latest regulatory standards.","src/content/legal/Digital Operational Resilience Testing.md","86421874cc3d0401",{"html":125,"metadata":126},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Legal Basis: Articles 24–27 of DORA (EU Regulation 2022/2554)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Digital operational resilience testing\u003C/strong> is a core regulatory requirement for financial entities under DORA.
