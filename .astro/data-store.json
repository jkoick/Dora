It ensures that firms can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.\n\nIntroduced by the European Commission, DORA enforces consistent risk management frameworks and testing practices across the industry—ensuring financial stability and consumer protection.\n\n---\n\n### Testování Bezpečnostních Opatření IKT\n\n**Testování bezpečnostních opatření IKT** is a cornerstone of DORA compliance. It involves:\n\n- **Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT):** Simulated attacks to identify system vulnerabilities\n- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Routine scans to evaluate and patch weaknesses\n- **Incident Response Evaluation:** Drills and audits to test readiness and crisis procedures\n- **Third-Party Risk Testing:** Ensuring external partners uphold security standards\n- **Network and Application Layer Testing:** In-depth review of infrastructure under real-world conditions\n\n---\n\n### Why DORA Testing Matters\n\nAs digital services expand, the potential attack surface grows. Without robust testing protocols, organizations are vulnerable to:\n\n- Data breaches and service downtime\n- Financial and reputational damage\n- Non-compliance penalties from EU regulatory bodies\n\n**DORA testing ensures:**\n\n- Operational continuity\n- Evidence-based security improvements\n- Resilience against cyber threats\n- Auditability and accountability\n\n---\n\n### Who Needs to Comply?\n\nDORA applies to a wide range of entities, including but not limited to:\n\n- Banks and insurance companies\n- Investment firms and payment processors\n- Cloud service providers and software vendors\n- Managed security services and analytics platforms\n\nIf your organization supports any critical digital function in the EU's financial ecosystem, DORA compliance is not optional—it's a mandate.\n\n---\n\n### Preparing for DORA Testing\n\nTo prepare for DORA compliance, organizations should:\n\n1. **Conduct a Gap Analysis** to assess current security posture\n2. **Develop an ICT Risk Management Framework** based on DORA guidelines\n3. **Design a Threat-Led Testing Strategy** aligned with sector-specific threats\n4. **Integrate Reporting Systems** to document and escalate incidents\n5. **Engage with Third-Party Experts** for independent evaluations\n\n---\n\n### Ready to Get Compliant?\n\nAchieving DORA compliance isn't just a legal requirement—it’s a strategic investment in your digital resilience. We help organizations implement structured, real-world testing of ICT defenses to ensure readiness and trustworthiness.\n\n📩 **[Contact us today](/contact/)** to begin your path to DORA-aligned operational security.","src/content/integration/ICTSecurityMeasures.md","7317c15f02157376",{"html":888,"metadata":889},"\u003Ch4 id=\"what-is-dora\">What Is DORA?\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)\u003C/strong> is an EU regulation that aims to strengthen the IT security of financial institutions and critical ICT service providers.

Simulation of Realistic Attack Scenarios\n\nAt the heart of penetration testing and Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) is the emulation of advanced cyber threats:\n\n- Simulated attacks mirror **real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by actual threat actors.\n- Focus is on targeting:\n  - **Critical systems**\n  - **Business processes**\n  - **Human vulnerabilities**\n  - **Misconfigurations**\n  - **Supply chain exposures**\n\nThe goal is to identify exploitable weaknesses under **realistic adversarial conditions**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Assessment of Detection and Response Capabilities\n\nBeyond technical vulnerabilities, testing evaluates the organization’s **cyber defense posture**, including:\n\n- **Detection effectiveness**: How quickly are threats identified?\n- **Alert generation and escalation**: Are alerts accurate and acted upon?\n- **Response coordination**: How well do teams contain and mitigate incidents?\n\nThis phase helps measure the **maturity of incident response workflows**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reporting, Remediation, and Continuous Improvement\n\nAfter the tests:\n\n- **Detailed reports** are produced, outlining:\n  - Identified vulnerabilities\n  - Risk levels and potential impact\n\n- **Actionable recommendations** are shared with stakeholders.\n- **Remediation plans** are developed collaboratively with technical and operational teams.\n\nThe lessons learned inform:\n\n- **Security awareness training**\n- **Refinement of internal processes**\n- **Improvements to digital operational resilience**\n\nRegular testing fosters a **culture of continuous improvement** and proactive risk management.","src/content/tests/4.md","2eea149d8291ef40",{"html":1843,"metadata":1844},"\u003Cp>Penetration Testing and TLPT (Threat-Led Penetration Testing)\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"penetration-testing-and-tlpt-review\">Penetration Testing and TLPT Review\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-planning-and-scoping-of-tests\">1.
