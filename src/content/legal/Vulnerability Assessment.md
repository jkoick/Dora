## What Vulnerability Assessment Involves

- **Comprehensive System Scanning**  
  We regularly perform automated and manual scans of your ICT infrastructure, applications, and networks to detect known and emerging vulnerabilities. This includes both internal and external assets, covering servers, endpoints, cloud environments, and third-party integrations.

- **Risk-Based Prioritization**  
  Identified vulnerabilities are analyzed and prioritized based on their potential impact, exploitability, and relevance to your organization’s critical functions. We provide clear, actionable recommendations to address the most significant risks first.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Reporting**  
  Our service includes ongoing monitoring for new vulnerabilities, threat intelligence integration, and timely reporting to ensure your security posture remains current. You receive concise, management-ready reports with remediation guidance and compliance mapping to DORA requirements.

- **Alignment with Regulatory Expectations**  
  The assessment process is fully aligned with DORA’s standards, supporting audit readiness and demonstrating proactive risk management to regulators and stakeholders.
