> Legal Basis: Article 11 DORA (EU Regulation 2022/2554)

Regular testing of **business continuity and disaster recovery (BCP/DRP) plans** is a mandatory requirement under Article 11 of DORA. This ensures that financial entities can **maintain or quickly resume critical operations** after ICT disruptions, in line with regulatory expectations.

## What the Testing Involves

- **Scenario-Based Exercises**  
  We simulate realistic disruptions—such as system outages, cyber incidents, or supplier failures—to verify that your BCP/DRP plans are actionable and effective.

- **Inclusion of Key Stakeholders**  
  Testing involves relevant staff and, where necessary, third parties (e.g., critical service providers), ensuring everyone understands their roles and responsibilities during a crisis.

- **Validation of Recovery Procedures**  
  We assess the ability to restore systems and data within defined recovery time (RTO) and recovery point (RPO) objectives, checking the effectiveness of backups, failover, and communication processes.

- **Actionable Outcomes**  
  After each test, we provide clear feedback, identify gaps, and recommend improvements to strengthen your organization’s resilience and compliance with DORA.

Our approach guarantees that your **continuity and recovery strategies** are not just compliant, but also **practical and robust** in the face of real-world challenges.
