> Legal Basis: Articles 24–27 of DORA (EU Regulation 2022/2554)

**Digital operational resilience testing** is a core regulatory requirement for financial entities under DORA. The regulation mandates a **comprehensive, risk-based approach** to regularly assess and strengthen the organization’s ability to withstand and recover from ICT-related disruptions. Our services ensure full compliance with these obligations and deliver tangible improvements in operational resilience.

---

## Regulatory Requirement

Articles 24 to 27 of DORA require all financial entities (except microenterprises) to **establish, maintain, and periodically review** a robust digital operational resilience testing program. This program must cover all **critical ICT systems, processes, and services**, including those provided by third parties. The aim is to **identify vulnerabilities**, test the **effectiveness of controls**, and ensure **rapid recovery** from incidents.

## Our Testing Services

### Security and Functionality

**Testing of ICT Systems**  
We conduct structured assessments of your ICT infrastructure to verify that security controls and business-critical functionalities operate as intended. This includes reviewing **access management**, **data protection**, **system configurations**, and **compliance with security policies**. The goal is to proactively identify weaknesses that could impact **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

---

### Vulnerability Assessment

Our vulnerability assessments use **automated and manual techniques** to identify known and emerging vulnerabilities across your systems, applications, and networks. We **prioritize findings based on risk** and provide **actionable recommendations** for remediation, helping you stay ahead of evolving threats.

---

### Penetration Testing

We simulate **real-world cyberattacks** targeting your most critical assets, using both **internal and external perspectives**. Our approach follows **industry best practices and regulatory expectations**, uncovering exploitable weaknesses and testing the **effectiveness of your detection and response capabilities**.

---

### Business Continuity and Recovery Testing

We design and execute scenarios that challenge your **business continuity and disaster recovery plans**. This includes simulating **system outages, data loss, or supplier failures** to validate your ability to restore operations within defined **recovery time and point objectives**. The exercises ensure that **backup, failover, and communication processes** are effective and well-coordinated.

---

### Incident Response Testing

Our incident response tests evaluate your team’s readiness to **detect, manage, and recover from ICT incidents**. Through **tabletop exercises and live simulations**, we assess the **clarity of escalation paths**, **communication protocols**, and the **speed and accuracy** of incident containment and service restoration.
