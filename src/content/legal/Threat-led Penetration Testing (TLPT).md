> Legal Basis: Article 26 DORA (EU Regulation 2022/2554)

**Threat-led Penetration Testing (TLPT)**, also known as “red team” testing, is a regulatory requirement for selected financial entities under Article 26 of DORA. This advanced form of testing simulates realistic cyberattacks, mirroring tactics, techniques, and procedures used by genuine threat actors targeting critical business functions and ICT infrastructure.

---

## Regulatory Requirement

Article 26 DORA mandates that **designated entities must conduct TLPT at least once every three years**. The scope and methodology must be tailored to the institution’s threat landscape, with tests performed by **independent, qualified teams**.

The objective is to rigorously assess the organization’s ability to:

- **Prevent**
- **Detect**
- **Respond to**
- **Recover from** sophisticated cyber threats

This ensures both technical controls and organizational processes are **robust and effective**.

## Content and Approach of TLPT

- **Simulation of Real-World Attacks**  
  TLPT exercises replicate advanced, persistent threats targeting key assets, systems, and business services. The scenarios are designed based on current threat intelligence and are adapted to the organization’s specific risk profile.

- **End-to-End Testing**  
  The process covers the entire attack lifecycle—from initial reconnaissance and exploitation to lateral movement and data exfiltration—testing not only technical defenses but also detection and response capabilities.

- **Independent Execution**  
  Tests are conducted by external or internal teams with sufficient independence, ensuring objectivity and adherence to strict confidentiality and safety protocols.

- **Comprehensive Reporting and Remediation**  
  Findings are documented in detailed reports, highlighting vulnerabilities, gaps in detection and response, and prioritized recommendations for remediation. The results inform continuous improvement of security posture and operational resilience.

- **Regulatory and Supervisory Oversight**  
  TLPT must be coordinated with relevant authorities, and results may be shared with supervisors as required by DORA. The process is subject to regulatory standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

## Value Delivered

- Provides the **highest level of assurance** regarding the organization’s resilience against advanced cyber threats
- Identifies exposures that **traditional testing may overlook**, including process and human-factor weaknesses
- **Strengthens incident response capabilities** and supports compliance with DORA’s most demanding requirements
- Demonstrates **proactive risk management** to regulators, clients, and partners
