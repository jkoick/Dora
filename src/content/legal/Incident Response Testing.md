> Legal Basis: Article 10 DORA (EU Regulation 2022/2554)

Incident response testing is a key requirement under DORA, designed to ensure that organizations are genuinely prepared to handle ICT incidents effectively and in full regulatory compliance.

## What Incident Response Testing Involves

- **Incident Simulations and Exercises**  
  We conduct realistic scenarios that mimic cyberattacks, technical failures, or other ICT incidents. These simulations test the organizationâ€™s ability to quickly detect, analyze, and respond to emerging situations.

- **Involvement of All Relevant Teams**  
  Exercises include not only IT specialists but also management, legal, communications, and other key staff. The goal is to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in the event of an incident.

- **Verification of Procedures and Communication**  
  We test whether escalation, decision-making, and both internal and external communication processes are functional and clear. Special emphasis is placed on timely management notification and, where required, regulatory incident reporting in line with DORA.

- **Feedback and Improvement**  
  After each exercise, we provide a clear analysis of strengths and weaknesses. We recommend specific steps to improve procedures, staff training, and updates to incident response plans.
