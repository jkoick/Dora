  title: Digital Operational Resilience Testing
  subtitle: DORA Compliance Services
  description: |
    Under Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector (DORA), all financial entities are required to test their ICT systems, tools, and processes regularly. The scope, type, and frequency of such testing must reflect the entity's size, risk profile, and criticality of its operations. Our services are designed to fulfil these regulatory obligations in a manner that is independent, proportionate, and audit-ready, supporting full alignment with Chapter IV of DORA.
