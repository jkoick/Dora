Testing Changes in ICT Infrastructure

## Review of Change Management Policies and Procedures

The assessment begins with a review of the organization’s **change management framework**, focusing on:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Approval workflows
- Risk assessment methodologies

Key considerations include:

- Ensuring **all ICT infrastructure changes**—such as software updates, hardware replacements, or network modifications—are:
  - Formally evaluated
  - Properly authorized
- Alignment with:
  - **Regulatory requirements**
  - **Internal security standards**

---

## Pre-Implementation Testing and Validation

Before deployment, proposed changes undergo thorough testing in **controlled environments** to confirm:

- **Compatibility** with existing systems
- **Security** posture is not compromised
- **Performance** standards are maintained

Testing methods include:

- Functional testing
- Integration checks
- Security vulnerability assessments

The goal is to **prevent the introduction of weaknesses or service disruptions**.

---

## Assessment of Rollback and Contingency Plans

The effectiveness of **rollback and contingency strategies** is also evaluated, focusing on:

- Ability to revert to previous stable configurations
- Data restoration procedures
- Communication protocols with stakeholders

Key success metrics include:

- **Minimized downtime**
- **Reduced data loss**
- **Rapid recovery** in the event of failed changes

---

## Post-Implementation Review and Continuous Improvement

Once changes are deployed, the organization conducts **post-implementation reviews** to evaluate:

- Impact on **operational stability**
- Effects on **security posture**

Tools and techniques used:

- System and performance monitoring
- Collection of user feedback

Findings are documented and leveraged to:

- **Refine change management processes**
- **Enhance organizational resilience**
- Support a culture of **continuous improvement**
