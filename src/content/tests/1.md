Assessment of Organizational and Technical Controls

## 1. Review of Security Controls

Testing ICT security measures starts with a comprehensive assessment of both organizational and technical controls designed to protect information assets. This includes:

- **Access Control Policies**
- **User Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms**
- **Physical, Logical, and Administrative Security Measures**

Evaluators verify:

- The **existence and adequacy** of security policies
- **Alignment with regulatory requirements** and **industry standards**

Methods used:

- Interviews
- Document reviews
- Walkthroughs of implemented processes

---

## 2. Verification of Access Management and Data Protection

### Key Focus Areas:

- **Access Management Controls**:
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Least Privilege Principle
  - Segregation of Duties

- **Testing Techniques**:
  - Simulated privilege escalation attempts
  - Evaluation of provisioning/deprovisioning procedures

- **Data Protection Measures**:
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Secure backup and storage protocols
  - Cryptographic key management

- **Additional Reviews**:
  - Regular audits of user access rights
  - Monitoring of privileged accounts

---

## 3. Evaluation of Security Monitoring and Preventive Measures

This evaluation focuses on:

- **Preventive Security Technologies**:
  - Firewalls
  - Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
  - Endpoint Protection Tools

- **Security Monitoring Capabilities**:
  - Configuration and effectiveness of SIEM solutions
  - Test alerts and response workflows

- **Patch Management**:
  - Identification, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities

- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Maintaining a hardened ICT environment

---

## 4. Testing Resilience Against Common Threats

### Threat Simulation:

- **Attack Vectors Tested**:
  - Phishing
  - Malware
  - Brute-force attacks

- **Social Engineering**:
  - Employee awareness and protocol adherence

### Evaluation Outcome:

- **Identification of Security Gaps**
- **Remediation Plan Development**
- **Training Program Enhancement**
- **Policy Refinement**

Emphasis is placed on **continuous improvement** to stay ahead of emerging threats and meet regulatory expectations.
