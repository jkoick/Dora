Testing Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans (BCP/DRP) Review of BCP/DRP Framework and Documentation

## 1. Assessment of BCP/DRP Documentation

The evaluation begins with a thorough review of the organization’s:

- **Business Continuity Policies**
- **Disaster Recovery Plans**
- **Supporting Documentation**

Key focus areas:

- Alignment with **regulatory requirements** and **industry best practices**
- Clear definition of **roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures**
- Identification of **critical business functions** and **operational dependencies**

---

## 2. Simulation of Disruption Scenarios

To validate the effectiveness of the BCP/DRP framework, the organization conducts simulations of realistic disruptions, such as:

- System outages
- Data center failures
- Loss of key suppliers

These scenarios are designed to test:

- **Technical recovery capabilities**
- **Business process continuity** under pressure

---

## 3. Evaluation of Recovery Procedures and Timelines

The organization measures its ability to restore operations through:

- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**
- **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**

The evaluation checks:

- The functionality of **backup solutions** and **failover mechanisms**
- The effectiveness of **communication channels** during incidents
- The **accuracy and speed** of system and data restoration

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement and Lessons Learned

Post-simulation analysis focuses on:

- Identifying **gaps and weaknesses** in the BCP/DRP framework
- Documenting **lessons learned**
- Updating plans and **training staff** accordingly

The goal is to ensure **resilience and readiness** through:

- Regular testing
- Plan refinement
- Adaptation to evolving risks
