Review of Detection Technologies and Tools

## 1. Assessment of Detection Technologies

The evaluation begins with identifying and assessing the deployed detection tools, such as:

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**

The focus is on:

- **Coverage**: Ensuring key assets are monitored.
- **Integration**: Seamless operation between tools.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ability to detect activities instantly.

**Effectiveness** is measured by how fast and accurately these systems detect unauthorized or suspicious behavior.

---

## 2. Evaluation of Detection Capabilities and Processes

To test detection performance, various threat scenarios are simulated. The evaluation includes:

- **Detection Techniques**:
  - Signature-based methods
  - Behavioral-based methods
  - Machine Learning-enhanced analysis

- **Assessment Criteria**:
  - Speed of detection
  - Alert generation and escalation
  - Minimizing exposure time

---

## 3. Analysis of Alert Management and Response Integration

This section examines how alerts are integrated into response workflows:

- **Alert Handling**:
  - Triage
  - Prioritization
  - Automated containment actions

- **Alert Quality**:
  - Clear, actionable information
  - Support for investigative workflows

- **Team Coordination**:
  - Effective handoff from detection to incident response

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement and Adaptation

Ongoing efforts ensure that detection remains robust and responsive:

- **Regular Testing**: Validates adaptability to new threats.
- **Review Processes**:
  - Detection logs
  - Incident reports
  - Post-incident analysis

- **Feedback Loops**: Drive updates to detection rules and improve tuning.

- **Adaptation**: Strategies evolve with the threat landscape to reduce false positives and enhance efficacy.
