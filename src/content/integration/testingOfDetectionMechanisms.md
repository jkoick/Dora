#### What Is DORA?

The **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** is an EU regulation that aims to strengthen the IT security of financial institutions and critical ICT service providers. It ensures that firms can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.

Introduced by the European Commission, DORA enforces consistent risk management frameworks and testing practices across the industry‚Äîensuring financial stability and consumer protection.

### Testov√°n√≠ Bezpeƒçnostn√≠ch Opat≈ôen√≠ IKT

**Testov√°n√≠ bezpeƒçnostn√≠ch opat≈ôen√≠ IKT** is a cornerstone of DORA compliance. It involves:

- **Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT):** Simulated attacks to identify system vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Routine scans to evaluate and patch weaknesses
- **Incident Response Evaluation:** Drills and audits to test readiness and crisis procedures
- **Third-Party Risk Testing:** Ensuring external partners uphold security standards
- **Network and Application Layer Testing:** In-depth review of infrastructure under real-world conditions

---

### Why DORA Testing Matters

As digital services expand, the potential attack surface grows. Without robust testing protocols, organizations are vulnerable to:

- Data breaches and service downtime
- Financial and reputational damage
- Non-compliance penalties from EU regulatory bodies

**DORA testing ensures:**

- Operational continuity
- Evidence-based security improvements
- Resilience against cyber threats
- Auditability and accountability

---

### Who Needs to Comply?

DORA applies to a wide range of entities, including but not limited to:

- Banks and insurance companies
- Investment firms and payment processors
- Cloud service providers and software vendors
- Managed security services and analytics platforms

If your organization supports any critical digital function in the EU's financial ecosystem, DORA compliance is not optional‚Äîit's a mandate.

### Preparing for DORA Testing

To prepare for DORA compliance, organizations should:

1. **Conduct a Gap Analysis** to assess current security posture
2. **Develop an ICT Risk Management Framework** based on DORA guidelines
3. **Design a Threat-Led Testing Strategy** aligned with sector-specific threats
4. **Integrate Reporting Systems** to document and escalate incidents
5. **Engage with Third-Party Experts** for independent evaluations
