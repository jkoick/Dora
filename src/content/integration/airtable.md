#### Digital operational resilience testing

Under Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector (DORA), all financial entities are required to test their ICT systems, tools, and processes regularly. The scope, type, and frequency of such testing must reflect the entityâ€™s size, risk profile, and criticality of its operations. Our services are designed to fulfil these regulatory obligations in a manner that is independent, proportionate, and audit-ready, supporting full alignment with Chapter IV of DORA.

#### Service Delivery Model

We offer flexible engagement options based on client needs and market structure:

- Direct Engagement (B2B): Financial entities contract us directly for testing services.
- Consultant-Supported Delivery (B2B2B): We work with legal or compliance consultants to integrate our technical outputs into broader DORA advisory packages.
- White-Labeling: Consultants may deliver our testing under their own brand, supported by backend service-level agreements.

#### Service Categories

###### 1. Baseline Testing

###### 2. Comprehensive Resilience Testing

###### 3. Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT)

###### 4. Regulatory Documentation Support (Optional Add-on)

We assist financial entities or partner consultants by providing structured outputs that support integration into the following regulatory documentation:

- ICT risk management framework
- Incident response and business continuity documentation
- Governance and audit trails for NCA inspections

This service ensures full traceability and evidentiary sufficiency in regulatory proceedings or supervisory reviews.
