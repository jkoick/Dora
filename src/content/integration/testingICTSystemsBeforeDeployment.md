#### Why Pre-Deployment & Maintenance Testing Is Critical

Changes to ICT systemsâ€”whether it's new software deployment, infrastructure upgrades, or configuration changesâ€”can introduce risks if not properly tested. **Pre-deployment and maintenance testing** ensures stability, security, and service continuity across your digital environment.

Whether you manage internal applications, cloud services, or hybrid infrastructure, every change must be validated before it impacts users or operations.

### What Does Pre-Deployment Testing Involve?

Testing ICT systems before deployment or maintenance involves verifying that all components function as expected in a safe, controlled environment. Common activities include:

- **Functional Testing:** Verifying that systems behave correctly under expected conditions
- **Integration Testing:** Ensuring new components integrate cleanly with existing infrastructure
- **Performance Testing:** Measuring system load capacity, latency, and responsiveness
- **Security Testing:** Checking for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations introduced by the changes
- **Rollback Validation:** Confirming that rollback procedures are documented and executable

---

### Maintenance-Related Testing Activities

During maintenance, it's essential to test changes both **before and after** implementation:

- **Pre-Maintenance Staging Tests:** Replicating the update in a test environment
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Evaluating dependencies, affected services, and risk areas
- **Backup Verification:** Ensuring critical data snapshots are valid before changes
- **Post-Maintenance Sanity Checks:** Validating system behavior after applying updates
- **Monitoring & Alerting Validation:** Confirming visibility of key metrics during and after change windows

### Best Practices for ICT System Testing

1. **Use Representative Test Environments:** Mirror production settings as closely as possible
2. **Automate Regression Tests:** Re-run test suites to catch unintended side effects
3. **Involve Stakeholders:** Developers, infrastructure, security, and business teams should all review change plans
4. **Document Test Results:** Maintain an audit trail of all test cases, outcomes, and lessons learned
5. **Use a Change Approval Process:** No deployment should occur without formal testing sign-off

### Benefits of Pre-Deployment and Maintenance Testing

- Avoid costly outages and service disruptions
- Detect and fix bugs or security flaws early
- Improve user satisfaction and operational reliability
- Reduce emergency rollbacks and unplanned downtime
- Align with ITIL, ISO 27001, and other compliance standards

---

### Use Cases Where Testing Is Essential

- Software version upgrades (OS, database, application)
- Infrastructure changes (servers, network equipment, cloud services)
- Security patching
- Deployment of new features or services
- Configuration changes to authentication, logging, or access controls

### Be Proactive, Not Reactive

Testing before deployment or maintenance is an investment in resilience. By detecting issues early, you save time, protect user experience, and safeguard critical systems.
