## Article 1: Introductory Provisions

**1.1** These terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as the "Terms and Conditions") govern the provision of ICT testing and related services by Digitize s.r.o., having its registered office at Primátorská 296/38, Libeň, 180 00 Prague 8, Czech Republic, registered under file number C 377632 kept at the Municipal Court in Prague, Business Registration Number: 178 39 246 (hereinafter referred to as "Digitize") to the contracting counterparty identified in an order pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 1.3 of these Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "Client") setting forth, among other things, the terms and conditions for (i) provision of ICT testing and digital operational resilience testing services as described in Article 1, paragraph 1.2 of these Terms and Conditions, (ii) provision of any agreed auxiliary advisory, in each case as specified in the relevant order, as described in Article 1, paragraph 1.3 of these Terms and Conditions.

**1.2** Digitize provides ICT testing and digital operational resilience testing services (including, as applicable, vulnerability assessments, scenario-based testing, penetration testing including TLPT, reporting, and regulatory mapping) (hereinafter referred to as the "Services"). The specific scope, timelines, fees and any tangible and intangible work products and outputs that Digitize is required to provide under an order pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 1.3 of these Terms and Conditions, including without limitation reports, findings, matrices, evidence records (such as screenshots, logs or packet captures), test plans and execution summaries, and regulatory/compliance mapping sheets, in the form and format specified in the order pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 1.3 of these Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "Deliverables"), are defined in the applicable order pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 1.3 of these Terms and Conditions.

**1.3** The Services are performed in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and as further specified (i) in the statement of work issued by the Client and accepted by Digitize, or (ii) in the service proposal issued by Digitize and accepted by the Client, which references these Terms and Conditions and sets out scope, Deliverables, timelines, and fees (hereinafter referred to as the "Order"). Together with these Terms and Conditions, each Order forms a binding agreement between Digitize and the Client (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement").

**1.4** These Terms and Conditions are incorporated by reference into every Order. In case of conflict, the Order prevails for that engagement, unless the Order expressly provides otherwise. Any Client purchasing terms on or attached to a purchase order or similar document shall not apply unless expressly accepted by Digitize in the Order.

## Article 2: Engagement

**2.1** The Services are provided exclusively to businesses. By placing an Order, the Client represents it acts within its trade, business, or profession and is not a consumer.

**2.2** The Client shall, at its cost and in a timely manner: (i) provide all information, access, test accounts, documentation, contacts and facilities reasonably required for performance; (ii) identify maintenance windows or permissible testing periods; and (iii) designate an operational contact for incident/"kill switch" communications during testing.

**2.3** The Client represents and warrants that it owns or is duly authorized to have the relevant assets, environments and systems subjected to the Services, and that it has obtained all required consents, approvals and notices (including any third parties) permitting lawful performance of the Services.

**2.4** The Client shall implement and maintain appropriate legal, organizational, physical, administrative and technical measures to safeguard any access credentials, test environments and Deliverables provided or made available in connection with the Services, and to protect them against unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, use, modification or loss. The Client shall notify Digitize promptly of any unauthorized access or use.

**2.5** If a consultant, law firm, or other intermediary contracts as the Client for the benefit of an end recipient, such end recipient shall be identified by the Client in the Order as the "End Client" or "Beneficiary". The Client remains responsible for coordination with the End Client and for the accuracy and completeness of information supplied to Digitize.

**2.6** Dates stated in an Order are estimates unless expressly identified as binding. Delays or additional effort caused by missing access, incomplete information, third-party restrictions, or other Client-side dependencies entitle Digitize to reasonable extensions and equitable fee adjustments.

**2.7** Digitize may refuse to commence or may suspend the Services, in whole or in part, by written notice (which may be contemporaneous or given promptly after suspension in an emergency) if: (i) the Client is in breach of these Terms and Conditions, and in particular Article 4, (ii) the Client fails to provide cooperation, access or authorizations reasonably required, (iii) performance would contravene law or third-party rights, or (iv) proceeding would pose an unacceptable operational or security risk.

**2.8** The Client agrees that its Order hereunder is neither contingent on the delivery of any future Deliverables or features nor dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Digitize regarding future features of the Services.

<br>

## Article 3: Fees, Invoicing, Taxes

**3.1** Fees are as set out in the applicable Order. Payments shall be made by bank transfer to the account designated on the invoice (or other method agreed in writing). Payment is deemed made when funds are received in Digitize's bank account.

**3.2** Unless the Order expressly states otherwise, fees are quoted in EUR and exclusive of Taxes.

**3.3** Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including travel and accommodation) incurred in performing the Services are reimbursable at cost, provided they are pre-approved by the Client in writing or fall within any pre-approved budget in the Order.

**3.4** If performance requires re-testing, re-scheduling, stand-by time, or additional effort caused by Client-side delays or omissions, Digitize is entitled to equitable fee adjustments at the Order rates, or, if not stated, at Digitize's standard rates notified to the Client in advance.

**3.5** Digitize shall invoice in accordance with the invoice schedule in the Order. If the Order does not specify a schedule: (i) time-and-materials engagements are invoiced monthly in arrears; and (ii) fixed-price engagements are invoiced 50% on Order acceptance and 50% on delivery of the principal Deliverables.

**3.6** Invoices are due and payable within 14 days from invoice date, without set-off or deduction, except for any withholding required by law as stipulated by Article 3, paragraph 3.13 of these Terms and Conditions.

**3.7** Invoices may be issued and delivered electronically to the billing contact designated by the Client.

**3.8** Any undisputed amount not received by the due date accrues statutory interest (or, if permissible and higher, 1% per month) until paid, plus reasonable costs of collection.

**3.9** Digitize may withhold or delay Deliverables and, per Article 2, paragraph 2.7 of these Terms and Conditions, refuse to commence or suspend the Services where undisputed amounts remain unpaid when due.

**3.10** If Services are suspended for non-payment, Digitize may charge a reasonable remobilization fee and adjust delivery dates accordingly.

**3.11** All fees are exclusive of value-added tax, sales, use, withholding and similar taxes, duties, or levies (hereinafter referred to as the "Taxes"), which shall be payable by the Client, except for taxes based on Digitize's net income.

**3.12** Where a reverse-charge or self-assessment mechanism applies, the Client is responsible for any necessary filings and payments.

**3.13** If the Client is required by law to withhold any Taxes from a payment, the payable amount shall be grossed up so that Digitize receives the net amount it would have received absent such withholding. The Client shall provide appropriate withholding certificates evidencing the deduction and remittance.

**3.14** The Client is responsible for bank charges and transfer fees so that Digitize receives the invoiced net amount.

**3.15** The Client must notify Digitize in writing of any bona fide dispute, identifying the disputed items and reasons, no later than 10 days after receipt of the invoice, otherwise the invoice is considered undisputed.

**3.16** Amounts properly disputed in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 3.15 of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed overdue for purposes of Article 2, paragraph 2.7 of these Terms and Conditions while the dispute is pending in good faith.

**3.17** For engagements with a stated term longer than 12 months or for renewals, Digitize may adjust rates effective on renewal or for future Orders upon 30 days' prior written notice; such changes shall not affect fees already fixed in a current Order unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## Article 4: Prohibited Acts & Restrictions

**4.1** The Client shall not request, permit, or instruct Digitize to perform any act that would breach these Terms and Conditions, the laws of the Czech Republic, laws of the Client's jurisdiction or third-party rights, nor provide false, incomplete, or misleading authorizations or attestations of control over assets.

**4.2** Testing of assets, environments, IP ranges, domains, applications, accounts, or data not expressly identified as in scope in the Order is prohibited. Systems owned or operated by third parties (e.g., cloud/SaaS, group entities, processors, suppliers) shall not be tested without the third party's prior written authorization provided by the Client.

**4.3** Absent explicit written authorization in the Order, the following are prohibited: (i) denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS), load or stress testing, (ii) destructive payloads or deliberate data corruption, (iii) persistent footholds/backdoors or lateral movement beyond minimal proof-of-exploit, (iv) exploitation that irreversibly alters configurations or production data, (v) credential-stuffing using breached/illicit datasets or brute-force beyond agreed thresholds, (vi) use of malware/custom implants other than vetted, controllable test tooling expressly approved in writing.

**4.4** Phishing, vishing, SMShing, pretexting, tailgating, badge cloning, or other social engineering/physical intrusion activities are prohibited unless expressly authorized in the Order, which must set scope, targeting limits, patterns, and clean-up measures.

**4.5** The Client shall not require Digitize to exfiltrate personal data or confidential business data beyond what is strictly necessary to evidence a vulnerability; shall not provide unnecessary special-category data; and shall not supply illicit or unlawfully obtained datasets (including breach corpora) for testing.

**4.6** The Client and any "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order shall not perform concurrent change activities (e.g., releases, maintenance) that materially interfere with testing or obscure results, except where coordinated and documented with Digitize in advance.

**4.7** The Client shall not (i) publicly disclose Deliverables, findings, methodology, or other confidential information except on a need-to-know basis or as required by law, (ii) use Deliverables to conduct unauthorized testing or attacks, (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, or publish Digitize's tooling, scripts, or methodology, (iv) resell, sublicense, or benchmark the Services or Deliverables, or (v) permit or enable any third party to access or attempt to access the Services or Deliverables without Digitize's prior written consent.

**4.8** Where an "End Client" or "Beneficiary" is identified in the Order, the Client shall procure by contract that the "End Client" or "Beneficiary" (and its personnel) is bound by restrictions and protections no less stringent than those in Article 4, paragraph 4.7 of these Terms and Conditions and the Agreement's intellectual property (including, but not limited to Article 7 of these Terms and Conditions) and confidentiality provisions (including, but not limited to Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions), including a prohibition on public disclosure of Deliverables and findings. The Client shall include in its contract with the "End Client" or "Beneficiary" an express clause identifying Digitize as an intended third-party beneficiary with the direct right to enforce respective obligations against the "End Client" or "Beneficiary".

**4.9** The Client is liable to Digitize for any act or omission of the "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order (and its personnel) that would breach Article 4, paragraph 4.7 or 4.8 of the Agreement if committed by the Client; any such breach shall be treated as the Client's own breach.

**4.10** Upon Digitize's reasonable request, the Client shall provide written evidence (with commercially sensitive terms reasonably redacted) that the flow-down obligations in Article 4, paragraph 4.8 of these Terms and Conditions have been implemented.

**4.11** For any proven breach of Article 4, paragraph 4.7 or 4.8 of these Terms and Conditions, the Client shall pay Digitize a contractual penalty of EUR 10,000 per breach, payable within 14 days of Digitize's written demand. Payment of the contractual penalty is without prejudice to Digitize's right to seek damages in excess of the contractual penalty to the extent permitted by applicable law and to exercise any other remedies available under the Agreement (including suspension under Article 2, paragraph 2.7 of these Terms and Conditions).

**4.12** To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Client hereby assigns, and to the extent future agrees to assign, to Digitize any and all claims the Client has or may have against the "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order, arising from that party's breach of confidentiality, non-publication/restricted-use obligations concerning the Deliverables, or intellectual-property/methodology restrictions corresponding to these Terms and Conditions (including Article 7 and Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions). As a backstop, the Client hereby irrevocably appoints Digitize as its attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution) solely to enforce such assigned or assignable claims in the Client's name if (i) the Client fails to commence appropriate enforcement action within five 5 business days after written notice from Digitize, or (ii) urgent injunctive relief is reasonably required to prevent or stop unauthorized disclosure or use. This power of attorney is limited to preparing, filing and prosecuting claims, seeking interim relief, and executing documents reasonably necessary for such enforcement; it shall be irrevocable until the relevant dispute is finally resolved. Enforcement by Digitize under this Article 4, paragraph 4.12 of these Terms and Conditions does not relieve the Client of its obligations under these Terms and Conditions. The Client shall provide reasonable cooperation and access to information and evidence necessary for enforcement, subject to reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket costs by the party requesting such cooperation, without prejudice to any recovery of costs from the "End Client" or "Beneficiary".

**4.13** Any material breach of this Article 4 constitutes a material breach of the Agreement.

**5.4** Upon a timely and substantiated claim under Article 5, paragraph 5.3 of these Terms and Conditions, Digitize will, at its option and expense, re-perform the non-conforming Services or correct/replace the affected Deliverables within a reasonable period. If re-performance or correction is not feasible, Digitize will provide a proportionate refund of fees paid for the non-conforming portion.

**5.7** The Client shall be responsible for verifying and ensuring that under applicable law any Deliverables are admissible in court proceedings, administrative proceedings or any other legal proceedings that Client or any third person may wish to utilize the Deliverables.

**5.8** Findings depend on the scope, timing, techniques, tooling, and information provided; false negatives/positives may occur, especially where scope restrictions or third-party constraints apply.

**5.11** Unless expressly stated in the Order, the Services and any Deliverables do not constitute legal, tax, accounting, auditing, or assurance advice.

**5.12** Digitize makes no warranty with respect to third-party software, services, platforms, or environments (including cloud/SaaS/providers) and disclaims any responsibility for their performance, security, or availability. Any third-party warranties are passed through to the extent legally permissible.

## Article 6: Limitation of Liability

**6.1** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Digitize, its affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, licensors, or employees be liable for any lost profits, revenue, sales, data, or costs of procuring substitute goods or services; property damage; personal injury; business interruption; loss of business information; or any special, direct, indirect, incidental, economic, cover, punitive, or consequential damages, however caused and regardless of the theory of liability, whether arising under contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the Services and/or any Deliverables, even if Digitize and its affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, licensors, or employees have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**6.2** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, Digitize, its affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, licensors, and employees disclaim all representations, warranties, or conditions, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. Digitize makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees that the Services or any Deliverables will be accurate, reliable, current, uninterrupted, error-free, or free from loss, destruction, damage, corruption, attack, viruses, interference, hacking, or other security intrusions. Digitize disclaims any liability for any inability to use or access the Services and/or any Deliverables, or for any issues with data provided through them.

**6.3** In certain countries and jurisdictions where the exclusion of liability is not permitted but limitation of liability is allowed, the liability of Digitize, its affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, licensors, and employees shall be limited to the amount the Client paid for the Services.

**6.4** The Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Digitize and its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, actions, fines, penalties, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with: (i) the Client's breach of the Agreement, including Article 2, paragraph 2.3 and 2.4 and Article 4, paragraph 4.8 of these Terms and Conditions, (ii) any allegation that testing was performed without proper authorization or in violation of a third party's acceptable-use policies or rights, (iii) the Client's or any End Client's/Beneficiary's use, disclosure, or other handling of the Deliverables (including any misuse or public disclosure contrary to the Order and/or these Terms and Conditions), or (iv) data, materials, instructions, or access provided by the Client that infringe rights or cause loss. Digitize shall provide the Client with prompt written notice of the claim (failure to do so only relieving the Client to the extent materially prejudiced), reasonable cooperation at the Client's expense, and the sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the Client shall not settle any claim that imposes any obligation, admission of liability, or non-monetary relief on Digitize without Digitize's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). This indemnity shall not apply to the extent a claim is finally determined to have resulted from Digitize's willful misconduct or fraud.

**6.5** If any provision in this Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions is found to be void or if Digitize is held liable for any losses, damages, or other claims under applicable law, the Client agrees that Digitize's liability shall be limited to the total amount the Client paid for the Services.

**6.6** No claim, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Order and/or these Terms and Conditions may be brought by the Client more than 6 months after the earlier of: (i) the date on which the Client first knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the facts giving rise to the claim, or (ii) delivery of the relevant deliverable or completion of the relevant Services, whichever is later, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

**6.7** Digitize's liability shall be limited to the proportion of the loss that is just and equitable having regard to the extent of that Digitize's responsibility.

**6.8** The exclusions and limitations in this Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions apply even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.

## Article 7: Intellectual Property

**7.1** All methods, know-how, methodologies, processes, specifications, templates, checklists, tools, scripts, code, signatures, data sets and other intellectual property owned or controlled by Digitize prior to the commencement of the Services or developed independently of the Services (hereinafter referred to as "Background IP") remain the exclusive property of Digitize. Except as expressly granted in this Article 7, no rights or licenses are granted to the Client, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

**7.2** Deliverables may contain or embed elements of the Background IP. Subject to payment of all fees due, Digitize grants the Client a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to use, copy, store and internally distribute the Deliverables for the Client's legitimate business purposes, including for regulatory, supervisory, audit and assurance processes (hereinafter referred to as the "License"). The License permits disclosure of Deliverables to the Client's affiliates, auditors, advisers, and competent authorities, and to any End Client/Beneficiary identified in the Order, provided such recipients are bound by confidentiality and use restrictions no less stringent than those in these Terms and Conditions. The Deliverables shall not be published or made generally available without Digitize's prior written consent.

**7.3** Digitize retains all right, title and interest in and to the Background IP. To the extent any Background IP is included or embedded in the Deliverables, the Client's rights are limited to the License and only to the extent necessary to use the Deliverables as delivered. The Client shall not (and shall procure that any "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order and third parties do not) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, extract, disclose, publish or use Digitize's tools, scripts, signatures or methodology except as strictly necessary to use the Deliverables under the License and in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 4.8 of these Terms and Conditions.

**7.4** Any data, content, documentation, systems information, trademarks or other materials provided by or on behalf of the Client (including any "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order) for performance of the Services (hereinafter referred to as "Client Materials") remain the Client's property. The Client grants Digitize a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, host, process, transmit and modify the Client Materials solely as necessary to perform the Services and to deliver the Deliverables, including the right to sub-license to Digitize's subcontractors under written confidentiality obligations (hereinafter referred to as the "Client Materials License").

**7.5** Any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by the Client or its personnel in connection with the Services or Deliverables (hereinafter referred to as "Feedback") may be used by Digitize. The Client grants Digitize a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to use, reproduce, adapt and incorporate the Feedback into Digitize's services, processes and Background IP (hereinafter referred to as the "Feedback License"), with no obligation to use or attribute.

**7.6** Digitize may generate aggregated and/or de-identified statistics, telemetry, performance data, usage patterns and testing metadata derived from performance of the Services (hereinafter referred to as "Service Data"), provided the Service Data does not disclose the Client's identity or Confidential Information. Digitize owns the Service Data and may use it for service improvement, benchmarking and threat-intelligence purposes.

**7.7** All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Services or Deliverables are trademarks of their respective owners. Trademarks of Digitize (hereinafter referred to as "Trademarks") remain the property of Digitize; any third-party marks (hereinafter referred to as "Other Trademarks") remain the property of their respective owners. Digitize may use the Client's name and logo in customary B2B customer lists and case-study references unless the Client opts out by written notice. Any other use of Trademarks or Other Trademarks requires prior written consent of the owning party (hereinafter referred to as "Intellectual Property").

**7.8** Deliverables may reference or include third-party materials (including standards, advisories or open-source content). Rights to such materials remain with their respective owners and are licensed to the Client only to the extent permitted by their applicable terms.

**7.9** Digitize may retain archival copies of Deliverables and related working papers strictly for evidentiary, insurance, regulatory and quality-assurance purposes, subject to confidentiality obligations.

**7.10** This Article 7 of these Terms and Conditions survives termination or expiry of the Agreement.

<br>

## Article 8: Confidentiality

**8.1** Any non-public information disclosed by a party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party") in connection with the negotiation, performance or receipt of the Services, which is designated as confidential or which, given its nature or the circumstances of disclosure, reasonably should be understood to be confidential - including without limitation technical, security, testing and operational information, business plans, pricing and commercial terms, system diagrams, access credentials, vulnerability details and proofs-of-concept, reports and draft reports, and any personal data - shall be deemed confidential information (hereinafter referred to as "Confidential Information"). The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar importance, and in any event not less than a reasonable degree of care.

**8.2** The Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information solely for performing or receiving the Services and exercising rights expressly granted under the Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Permitted Purpose"), and shall not disclose it to any person except to its and its affiliates' employees, officers, professional advisers, insurers, auditors, and subcontractors who have a strict need-to-know for the Permitted Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those set out herein (collectively, "Permitted Recipients"). Where the Client has identified an "End Client" or "Beneficiary" in the Order, the Client shall procure by contract that such "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order (and its personnel) is bound by confidentiality and use restrictions no less stringent than those in this Article 8 and Article 4, paragraph 4.8 of these Terms and Conditions; any breach by an "End Client" or "Beneficiary" identified in the Order shall be treated as the Client's own breach.

**8.3** Confidential Information does not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by contemporaneous written records: (i) was already known to it without restriction prior to disclosure, (ii) was independently developed by it without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, (iii) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of the Agreement, or (iv) is rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations.

**8.4** If the Receiving Party or any Permitted Recipient is required by law, regulation, court order, stock exchange rule, or request of a competent supervisory or regulatory authority to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party may do so to the minimum extent required, provided it gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice (to the extent legally permissible) and reasonably cooperates, at the Disclosing Party's expense, to seek protective treatment. Where prior notice is not legally or practically possible (e.g., urgent supervisory inspections), notice shall be given as soon as legally permissible thereafter.

**8.5** Upon the Disclosing Party's written request or upon termination/expiry of the Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy Confidential Information and certify destruction, except that the Receiving Party may retain copies: (i) as required by applicable law, professional/insurance obligations or bona fide record-keeping policies (e.g., automated backups), and (ii) for evidentiary, dispute-resolution, and quality-assurance purposes, in each case subject to the confidentiality obligations herein. For clarity, Digitize may retain archival copies of Deliverables and working papers as described in Article 7, paragraph 7.9 of these Terms and Conditions.

**8.6** All Confidential Information remains the property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions grants any license or other rights to the Receiving Party except as expressly set out in the Order.

**8.7** The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate; the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

**8.8** The obligations in this Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions survive termination or expiry of the Agreement for 5 years from the date of disclosure; provided that obligations with respect to trade secrets, access credentials, private keys, and vulnerability proofs shall continue for so long as such items remain confidential. This Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions applies without prejudice to any data-protection obligations set out elsewhere in the Agreement.

<br>

## Article 10: Support Services

**10.1** If expressly purchased in an Order or addendum, Digitize shall provide support services (hereinafter referred to as "Support Services"). Support Services are limited to reasonable clarifications and guidance concerning the Deliverables or specified topic; they do not include remediation, configuration, monitoring, or incident response unless explicitly agreed.

**10.2** Unless different service levels are stated in the Order, Support Services are delivered during business hours (CET) with a commercially reasonable response target of 2 business days to acknowledge requests submitted to the designated support channel.

**10.3** Re-testing, validation of remediation, or additional analysis is out of scope and may be ordered separately on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis.

**10.4** Digitize may suspend Support Services for non-payment of undisputed fees or where performance would contravene law or third-party rights. Any suspension is without prejudice to Article 2, paragraph 2.7 of these Terms and Conditions and Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions.

## Article 11: Notices

**11.1** All notices, requests, consents, claims and other legally significant communications under the Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Notices") must be in writing and delivered by: (i) hand delivery or internationally recognized courier with tracking; (ii) registered/recorded mail, return receipt requested; or (iii) email to the designated notice addresses. Routine operational correspondence between project contacts does not constitute Notices unless expressly stated to be a Notice.

**11.2** Notices to Digitize shall be delivered to Digitize s.r.o., Primátorská 296/38, Libeň, 180 00 Prague 8, Czech Republic (or any replacement address notified in writing by Digitize), and/or to the email address specified for notices in the applicable Order (or any replacement email address notified in writing by Digitize).

**11.3** Notices to the Client shall be delivered to the postal address and email address for notices specified in the applicable Order (or any replacement addresses notified in writing by the Client).

**11.4** A Notice is deemed received: (i) if delivered by hand/courier, on signature of delivery, (ii) if sent by registered/recorded mail, on signature of delivery, and (iii) if sent by email, at the time of transmission as timestamped by the sender's system provided no bounce-back or error message is received within 24 hours; otherwise, upon actual receipt. If deemed receipt would occur outside business hours at the recipient's location, it is deemed to occur at 09:00 on the next business day.

**11.5** Notices shall be in English (unless the Parties agree otherwise in the Order). Signed Notices may be delivered as PDF or other commonly accepted electronic copies; counterparts and electronic signatures are valid.

**11.6** Either Party may change its notice details by giving a Notice under this Article 11 of these Terms and Conditions.

**11.7** This Article 11 of these Terms and Conditions does not govern the service of legal or regulatory proceedings, which shall be effected in accordance with applicable law.

## Article 12: General Provisions

**12.1** Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed to create or imply any partnership, joint venture, agency, employment relationship, or franchise. Digitize and the Client act as independent contractors, unless agreed otherwise. The Client has no authority to bind Digitize or create any obligation on its behalf.

**12.2** These Terms and Conditions and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Czech Republic.

**12.3** The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Michalovce District Court, Slovak Republic to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions or their subject matter or formation.

**12.4** The principles on the conflict of laws and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply.

**12.5** If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

**12.6** Each Party shall comply with all applicable laws in connection with the Agreement, including sanctions, export control, and trade compliance laws. The Client shall not request or permit activities that would cause Digitize to violate such laws.

**12.7** There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms and Conditions. For clarity, any "End Client" or "Beneficiary" in the Order has no privity of contract with Digitize and acquires no rights hereunder.

**12.8** No delay or default in performance of any obligation by Digitize shall constitute a breach of these Terms and Conditions to the extent such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by an event beyond the reasonable control of Digitize that prevents performance, including fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, failure of the internet or strikes, lockouts or labor difficulties.

**12.9** These Terms and Conditions may be amended only in writing signed or otherwise expressly agreed by both Digitize and Client, or unilaterally by Digitize for future Orders only; any such amendment shall not affect a current Order unless expressly agreed in writing.

**12.10** The Client may not assign, transfer, or novate the Agreement, in whole or in part, without Digitize's prior written consent. Digitize may assign or novate the Agreement to an affiliate or in connection with a reorganisation, merger, or sale of business, upon written notice to the Client. Any prohibited assignment is void.

**12.11** Digitize may engage subcontractors to perform the Services; Digitize remains responsible for their performance and shall bind them to confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those herein.

**12.12** These Terms and Conditions together with the applicable Order(s) constitute the entire agreement between Digitize and Client regarding the Services and supersede all prior proposals and agreements on that subject. In the event of conflict, the Order prevails for that engagement unless the Order expressly provides otherwise (see Article 1, paragraph 1.4 of these Terms and Conditions).

**12.13** A failure or delay by either Digitize or Client to exercise any right or remedy does not operate as a waiver of that or any other right or remedy. A waiver must be in writing and shall apply only to the specific instance identified.

**12.14** Payments due under the Agreement shall be made without set-off or deduction, except for any withholding required by law or as expressly agreed in writing (see Article 3 of these Terms and Conditions).

**12.15** The language of the Agreement is English, unless otherwise agreed in an Order.

**12.16** Headings are for convenience and do not affect interpretation. References to "including" mean "including without limitation." References to "business days" mean days other than Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays at the recipient's location.

**12.17** Client acknowledges that the Services are provided at its own exclusive initiative (i.e. in line with the principle of reverse solicitation).

**12.18** Without prejudice to any provision of these Terms and Conditions that expressly states it survives termination or expiry, the following provisions shall survive termination or expiry of the Agreement: Article 3, Article 4 (including paragraph 4.8), Article 5 (to the extent stated therein), Article 6, Article 7, Article 8, Article 11, and Articles 12, paragraphs 12.2–12.5, 12.7, and 12.12–12.18, together with any other provisions which by their nature are intended to survive. Termination or expiry does not affect any accrued rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities of either Digitize or Client as at the date of termination or expiry (including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Agreement which existed at or before that date).
