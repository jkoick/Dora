### Data safety

#### Security of Personal Data

**HOW**  
Even though we implement security measures designed to protect your data, no security system is impenetrable. Due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that data will be absolutely safe from interference by others during transmission over the internet or while stored in our systems.

Examples of security measures we use:

- SSL technologies to ensure full encryption
- PCI scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other breaches
- Encrypted and password-protected databases
- Antivirus software

**WHERE**  
Your data is stored on our servers in the Czech Republic; your personal data never leaves the EEA. We protect your data in the manner described in this document.

**RULES**  
Your personal data will be stored in accordance with the security policy of the controller and the processor (if engaged), and only for the period necessary to fulfill the purpose of processing.

Access to your personal data will be granted exclusively to persons authorized by the controller to process personal data, who process it based on the controller's instructions and in accordance with the controller's security policy.

Your personal data are backed up in accordance with the controller's retention rules. Your personal data will be completely deleted from backup storage as soon as this is possible under the backup rules. Personal data stored in backup repositories serve to prevent security incidents, particularly disruptions to data availability resulting from a security incident. The controller is obliged to ensure data backups in accordance with the security requirements of the Regulation and the Personal Data Protection Act. We store your personal data only for a limited time, and it will be deleted when it is no longer needed for the processing purposes as set out in the appendix to this statement.
